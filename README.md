# SoundPull C#
With SoundPull, you are able to pull user information, track information, and playlist information, along with others from SoundCloud with the help of Json.NET.

# Requirements
Json.NET

# Background Info
In SoundCloud, most information that can be pulled from its API resolve endpoint is in Json format, meaning that Json.NET is required in order to deserialize the information pulled from the API resolve endpoint into readable objects.

# Installation

Installing SoundPull and Json.NET very simple.

```
Install-Package Newtonsoft.Json
Install-Package Saker.SoundPull
```

# To Begin

```c#

```
