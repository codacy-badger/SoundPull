# Background Info
In SoundCloud, most information that can be pulled is in Json format, meaning that SoundPull uses Json.Net in order to deserialize the information pulled from the API resolve endpoint into objects that SoundPull can read.

# Installation

Installing SoundPull and Json.Net is very simple.

```
Install-Package Saker.SoundPull
Install-Package Newtonsoft.Json
```
